The link to my Polygon problem - https://polygon.codeforces.com/p9AKa3d/aritrar23/voldemorts-castle.

To run Test_Case_Generator.cpp, run it in Command Line, passing the no. of test cases as an argument, -"test-count".

Solution.cpp should run fine in any C++ environment. Just manually paste the output from running the Test_Case_Generator.cpp as the input to Solution.cpp.
